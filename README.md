## 📜 The Story

**One year ago, I didn't know PowerShell.**

I was trapped in cloud AI studios, typing prompts and copying outputs. I didn't understand Git. I didn't know what `node_modules` was. I just wanted to build things.

This IDE is not a product. It's a **journal** — 365 days of learning by breaking, fixing, and refusing to quit.

**Every file here was debugged at 2am.**  
**Every component was rebuilt at least 3 times.**  
**Every error message became a lesson.**

This is not a startup. This is not a resume.  
**This is sovereignty.**
